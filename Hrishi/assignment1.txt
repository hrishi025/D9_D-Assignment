# Lab Assignment 1 

Que. 1. Import hr-db.sql file into hr database

    -- First of all we will have to create hr database.
    -- Then we will have to give access of created database to user.

    -- first do root login
        mysql -u root -pmanager

    -- check avaliable databases
        show databases;

    -- then Create a database with name hr
        CREATE DATABASE hr;

    -- grant database privilages to user edac@localhost
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hr.* TO edac@localhost;
        
    -- then flush privilages
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    --then exit from root user
        exit
        
    -- then do the user login
        mysql -u edac -pedac

    -- now check wether the database 'hr' is accessible or not
        show databases;

    -- we can see the hr database in the list so we can go ahead
    -- as the database is accessible then we can import data into database
    -- first of all select the created database
        use hr;

    -- now we will check tables in database --> it will show "Empty set" as we havent done anything onto it
        show tables;

    -- So, then to import the data into database write SOURCE and/path/address
        SOURCE G:/CDAC/classwork/git/dbt/data/hr-db.sql

    -- after importing data we can check the added tables and see its contents
        show tables;

    -- here we can see that all the tables are imported
    -- to show tables we can use the following queries
        SELECT * FROM countries;
        SELECT * FROM departments;
        SELECT * FROM employees;
        SELECT * FROM job_history;
        SELECT * FROM jobs;
        SELECT * FROM locations;
        SELECT * FROM regions;

    -- to describe table
        DESCRIBE countries;
        DESCRIBE departments;
        DESCRIBE employees;
        DESCRIBE job_history;
        DESCRIBE jobs;
        DESCRIBE locations;
        DESCRIBE regions;
