--1. Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.

    EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON
    SELECT odate FROM orders GROUP BY odate;

    CREATE INDEX idx_odate ON orders(odate);

    DESC orders;

    EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON
    SELECT odate FROM orders GROUP BY odate;

--2. If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_onum ON orders(onum);

--3. Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.

    EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON
    SELECT odate,snum FROM orders GROUP BY odate,snum;

    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_snum ON orders(snum);

    EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON
    SELECT odate,snum FROM orders GROUP BY odate,snum;

--4. Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

    CREATE INDEX idx_snum_rating ON customers(snum, rating);

--5. How to speed-up fetching each order number with customer name and salesperson name?

    CREATE INDEX idx_onum ON orders(onum);
    CREATE INDEX idx_onum ON salespeople(sname);
    CREATE INDEX idx_onum ON customers(cname);
