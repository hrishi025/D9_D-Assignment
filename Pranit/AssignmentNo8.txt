1. Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_odate ON Orders (odate);



2. If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_orders_onum ON Orders (onum);



3. Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_odate ON Orders (odate);



4. Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_customers_rating ON customers (rating);

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_odate ON Orders (odate);



5. How to speed-up fetching each order number with customer name and salesperson name

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_onum ON orders (onum);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_cname ON customers (cname);
CREATE INDEX idx_salespeopler_sname ON salespeople (sname);

OR

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_onum_cnum_snum ON orders (onum,cnum,snum);
